# Final Game: Connect Four

# Game Overview

## Game Origin
Hi! I'm Emmaleigh Stone, the programmer of the **Final Game: Connect Four**. I decided to create a Connect Four game mainly on a whim. I discovered a video tutorial -- linked below in **Sources** -- for a Tic-Tac-Toe game, and I gauged that I would be able to take what I learned in it and apply it on a grander scale. Little did I realize that scale would be much, *much* greater.

## Target Audience
The **Final Game: Connect Four** was created with children in mind, presumably five- to twelve-year-olds, but all kids at heart are welcome! The color scheme is also very Christmassy by design, so anyone who carries year-round holiday cheer might enjoy the game too.

## Game Summary
The **Final Game: Connect Four** is a two-player game. The objective of the game is for a player create a line of four of their own-colored checkers-- either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Player One has green checkers, and Player Two has red checkers. The two players take turns trying to create their own line.

## Game Play
To start the **Final Game: Connect Four**, click on the button at the top of the window. The players will then see in that same button whose turn it is and what color their checkers are. Once a player makes a four-piece line with their checkers, the button at the top declares them the winner and prompts them to play again.

## Conclusion
Thank you for taking the time to read the markdown file about the **Final Game: Connect Four**! I hope you enjoy playing the game double as much as I enjoyed making it!
