        <h1><span>Work Experience</span></h1>
        <p><span>From Septemper 2017 to April 2018, I worked as a cleaner for a janitorial company named Deb's Housekeeping Services. I now work as a managerial assistant and bookkeeping clerk for a non-emergency medical transportation company named Eagle Transportation and have for the past four years. I currently have no programming experience that isn't purely academic, but I am excited and eager to change that.</span></p>

        <h1><span>Hobbies</span></h1>
        <p><span>I don't have a ton of free time right now, but when I do, I spend it reading mostly. I also take ASL (American Sign Language) classes and am a part of a sign choir at my church <strong>Harvest</strong>. I enjoy watching shows, especially anything having to do with musicals, because I am a theater enthusiast. I love when I get time to spend with my three littlest cousins - one nine-month old and two five-month-olds - who are cute as can be.</span></p>

        <h1><span>Aspirations</span></h1>
        <p><span>After graduating from <strong>OTC</strong> next spring, I will continue my education by getting a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at <strong>Missouri State University (MSU)</strong>. My goal is to be a software developer. I would love to live somewhere near a coast someday - east or west, doesn't matter to me as long as I can smell the seawater in the air! - and just code to my heart's content.</span></p>
